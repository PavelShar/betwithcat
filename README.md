# Bet with cat!

This is a fun project inspired by [FIFA Confederations Cup Russia 2017](http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/index.html) and developed with my colleague [Vasily Sverchkov](https://github.com/drumnkvas), using Python and Django framework.

## Main idea   

On every major football event organizers select a special animal that predicts the outcome of meetings. In 2017, it turned out to be a cat Achilles, who lives in the Hermitage. Deafness will not prevent him to make a correct prediction! Or Achilles will not cope with his mission? We will see it in our project `#betWithCat`.

At each football match we will make a bet on 100 rubles, and count how many we won or lost, following the instructions of the Oracle. Follow our site and subscribe to Twitter :)
